# Haskell Machine Learning Library

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo) 
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hmatrix)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix)

A simple, educational machine learning library implemented in Haskell. This library demonstrates core machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Linear Regression** via gradient descent
- **Logistic Regression** for binary classification
- **KMeans Clustering** using Euclidean distance

The implementation leverages the high-performance [hmatrix](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix) package for numerical computations.

```

## Features

- **Linear Regression:** Implemented with gradient descent optimization.
- **Logistic Regression:** For binary classification tasks using gradient descent.
- **KMeans Clustering:** Cluster analysis using Euclidean distance.

---

## Prerequisites

Before building and running the project, ensure you have:

- **GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)**
  - Install via the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) or [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/).

- **hmatrix**
  - Provides robust numerical and linear algebra functionality.

### System Dependencies

The `hmatrix` package requires BLAS and LAPACK libraries. Install them as follows:

- **Ubuntu/Debian:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev
  ```
- **macOS (with Homebrew):**
  ```bash
  brew install openblas
  ```

---

## Installation

### Using Cabal

1. **Update the Cabal package list:**
   ```bash
   cabal update
   ```

2. **Install hmatrix:**
   ```bash
   cabal install hmatrix
   ```

3. **Build and Run:**
   If your project includes a `.cabal` file:
   ```bash
   cabal build
   cabal run
   ```

### Using Stack

1. **Create or Navigate to Your Stack Project:**
   ```bash
   stack new my-ml-project
   cd my-ml-project
   ```

2. **Configure Dependencies:**
   Add `hmatrix` to the `build-depends` section of your `.cabal` file or `package.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   build-depends:
     base >= 4.7 && < 5,
     hmatrix
   ```

3. **Build and Run:**
   ```bash
   stack build
   stack run
   ```

## Usage

The `Main.hs` file provides an example of how to use the library. For instance, here is a sample code snippet to train a linear regression model:

```haskell
import qualified Mllibrary as ML
import Numeric.LinearAlgebra

main :: IO ()
main = do
    -- Example dataset: 2 samples with 3 features each
    let xData = (2><3) [1,2,3,4,5,6] :: Matrix Double
        yData = vector [1,2] :: Vector Double
    
    -- Train a Linear Regression model using gradient descent
    let model = ML.fitLinearRegression xData yData 0.01 1000
    
    putStrLn "Linear Regression Results:"
    print model
```

Feel free to modify `Main.hs` to experiment with logistic regression or KMeans clustering as needed.
